The Department expects that fewer license applications will be submitted as a result of this rule for authorized users that meet the criteria of the exemption, for eligible transfers of defense articles and defense services to and between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Consequently, this exemption will relieve licensing burdens for some exporters. Regarding the expedited licensing review process when an ITAR exemption is not available for use, the Department expects minimal costs associated with this provision for the public, with the benefit of license applications involving Australia, the United Kingdom, or Canada being subject to faster adjudication."

              "question": "What are the regulatory analysis and notices associated with the proposed rule?",
              "answer": "The regulatory analysis and notices associated with the proposed rule include: the rulemaking is exempt from the notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1) as a military or foreign affairs function of the United States Government. Despite this exemption, the Department has elected to publish this proposed rule for public comment. The rule does not require analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act since it is exempt from the notice-and-comment provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553 as a military or foreign affairs function. The rulemaking does not involve a mandate that will result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any year and it will not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Therefore, no actions are deemed necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995."
