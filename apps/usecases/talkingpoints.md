I'm not a developer, I'm a tecnologist and a visionary who has caught a glimpse of what these Advanced AI systems are capable of.

This talk is to help inform and educate the public about the potential of these systems and how they can be used to help us all.

The reason I want to not just show, but explain the art of the possible is because I believe that the more people understand the how these systems work, the less fearful they will be of them.

Frontier models like GPT-4 are trained on a diverse range of data sources, including books, websites, and other texts, to generate human-like responses to a wide variety of prompts. The amount of data used to train these models is staggering. They are basically prediction enginges that can generate text with a reasonable degree of coherence and accuracy based on the contextual input they receive.

Let's explore what that actually means in practice.

Our written words are an outward expression of our thoughts. Collectiely, they form the basis of our communication with each other. They are the way we express our ideas, our feelings, our beliefs, our laws, our hopes, our dreams. They are the way we share our knowledge, our wisdom, our experiences, our stories. They are the way we connect with each other, the way we build relationships, the way we create communities.

LLMs have been trained on these words and understand how they relate to each other in a given context. In essence, a really good LLM is a model of human thought.


It is the way we communicate with each other. It is the way we express our ideas, our feelings, our beliefs, our hopes, our dreams. It is the way we share our knowledge, our wisdom, our experiences, our stories. It is the way we connect with each other, the way we build relationships, the way we create communities.
I beleive our words are an extension of our thoughts. They are the way we communicate with each other. They are the way we express our ideas, our feelings, our beliefs, our hopes, our dreams. They are the way we share our knowledge, our wisdom, our experiences, our stories. They are the way we connect with each other, the way we build relationships, the way we create communities.

I could have an human interaction at any point along the entire workflow to review and approve or modify the output of the AI, I would be able to ensure that the AI is generating content that is accurate, relevant, and appropriate for the intended objective.

Information Technology - (Infrastructure, Security, Privacy, Support)
Product - (Domain Expert, AI Developer, Data Egineer, UX/UI Designer)



=== Using AI to Generate Content
- How you prompt changes the output
- It's not a "yes man".  If you prompt, "look at this with a critical eye and tell me all the reasons this rule is not a good idea", it will do that.
- If you say find the security flaws.  It will do that.




# AI In Action

## Introduction

- what we cover
- my promise to them

## Advanced AI (Simple model vs Foundation model)

**Points to cover**

- Everyone is used to using AI (examples)
- Traditional AI (specific or domain purposes)
- Generative AI (broad applications)

- Misconceptions
  - You don't train the generative modesl
  - They don't learn from your data


## Advanced (Foundation model [Perceive, Learn, Abstract, Reason])

- About foundation models
  - Examples of Perceive, Learn, Abstract, Reason
  - Maybe here we talk about words and these are representations of how we think
  - Ilya and Andrej video talking points
  - Research that shows they write better, think better, and out perform marketers or managers at certain knowledge tasks
  - Stateless and dumber, but predicting the next word in context can do amazing things.

  - Predicting the next word with open endedness gets you freshman knowledge.  Predicting the next word with a narrow domain is really powerful.

## Applied AI (Enhance, Augment, Discover)

MSFT is seeing these 3 use cases that we're advancing across many verticals.  (Get talking points for this slide.)

## Applied AI (Use Case Examples)

## Applied AI (KT slides of the funnel)

- Use generated talking points here.

## Non-agentic Workflow

- Straightforward talking point of slides

## Agentic Workflow

- Straightforward talking point of slides

## Agentic Patterns

- Convert Andrew Ng stuff to talking points here

## Regulatory Insight Analyst

Describe what I have and work with GenAI to figure out best talking points.

- Ideas to improve 
  - Connection to internal documents
  - Connection to eCFR
  - Connection to Search to better research
  - Give overall persona - reshapes output
  - Parallel agents improve performance
  - Connect to regulations.gov for comments
  - Turn into a rulemaking assistant
  - Auto draft responses to comments
  - Direct interaction with human agents, wait for approval, edit within stages
  - Finetune model to write in a specific voice / legal framework
  - Final review make cohesive
