I'm not a developer, I'm a tecnologist and a visionary who has caught a glimpse of what these Advanced AI systems are capable of.

This talk is to help inform and educate the public about the potential of these systems and how they can be used to help us all.

The reason I want to not just show, but explain the art of the possible is because I believe that the more people understand the how these systems work, the less fearful they will be of them.

Frontier models like GPT-4 are trained on a diverse range of data sources, including books, websites, and other texts, to generate human-like responses to a wide variety of prompts. The amount of data used to train these models is staggering. They are basically prediction enginges that can generate text with a reasonable degree of coherence and accuracy based on the contextual input they receive.

Let's explore what that actually means in practice.

Our written words are an outward expression of our thoughts. Collectiely, they form the basis of our communication with each other. They are the way we express our ideas, our feelings, our beliefs, our laws, our hopes, our dreams. They are the way we share our knowledge, our wisdom, our experiences, our stories. They are the way we connect with each other, the way we build relationships, the way we create communities.

LLMs have been trained on these words and understand how they relate to each other in a given context. In essence, a really good LLM is a model of human thought.


It is the way we communicate with each other. It is the way we express our ideas, our feelings, our beliefs, our hopes, our dreams. It is the way we share our knowledge, our wisdom, our experiences, our stories. It is the way we connect with each other, the way we build relationships, the way we create communities.
I beleive our words are an extension of our thoughts. They are the way we communicate with each other. They are the way we express our ideas, our feelings, our beliefs, our hopes, our dreams. They are the way we share our knowledge, our wisdom, our experiences, our stories. They are the way we connect with each other, the way we build relationships, the way we create communities.
