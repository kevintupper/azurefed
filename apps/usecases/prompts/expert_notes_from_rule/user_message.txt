I am a {1} expert with specialized knowledge in {2}.

My help was requested for the following reason:

{3}

I will provide expert input to an Regulatory Insight Analyst who is writing an analysis on the proposed rule in your possession. They have already completed a draft outline. 

Here is the title and description of the section I am to contribute research for:

{4}
{5}

To conduct my research I and provide my expertise I need information from the Proposed Rule.

Your job is to return a Json Array in the approved format that contains question and answer pairs with the content relevant for my research.

I cannot do this without you since I don't have the rule. I will not have an opportunity to ask follow up questions, so please be thorough and exhaustive.

Rembmer to use the following format:

[
    {
        "question":"<question>",
        "answer":"in depth content from the rule that answers the question"
    }
]

And it should help me in figuring out what I need to research for the section I am contributing to.
