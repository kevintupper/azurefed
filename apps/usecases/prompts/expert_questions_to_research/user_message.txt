### MY QUESTION 

What questions should a {3} with specialized knowledge in {4} seek to research and answer or provide information to a Regulatory Insight Analyst in helping them complete the following section:  
  
Section title: {5}

Rembmer to use the following format:

        "reason":"<The intended purpose or rationale behind the research question.>"
